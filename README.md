# Stopwatch

This is a Flutter application that implements a simple stopwatch functionality. The app displays the time in hours, minutes, and seconds format and provides a "Play/Pause" button to start and stop the timer. Additionally, a "Reset" button is displayed when the timer is stopped and values are not at their initial state.
